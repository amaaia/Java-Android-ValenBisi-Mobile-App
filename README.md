# JAVA-ANDROID: ValenBisi Mobile App
Development of a mobile app for Android devices about Valenbisi, the bike rental system of the city of Valencia.


The app will allow users to check the status of the different bike stations and to create incident reports. It will use the services of the City Council of Valencia to retrieve data of Valenbisi bike stations. This query will initially be carried out using a JSON file that can be requested from the web service of Valenciaâ€™s open data website. On the list of bike stations, it will show the information about each of them. Next, a local database will be developed to allow the creation of new incident reports associated with each of the bike station. Finally, it will perform the query about the Valenbisi bike stations through the web service, in order to display real-time data to our users. This project will be developed using Android Studio.
